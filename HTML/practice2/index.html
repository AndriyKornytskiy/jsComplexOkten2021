				<b>Reebok International Limited</b> (/ˈriːbɒk/) is an Anglo-American footwear and clothing company that
				has been
				a
				subsidiary[4] of German sporting goods giant Adidas since August 2005.[5][6][7] Reebok produces and
				distributes
				fitness, running and CrossFit sportswear including clothing and footwear. It is the official footwear
				and
				apparel sponsor for Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), CrossFit, and Spartan Race.[8]
				<br>
				<br>
				In 1958, Reebok was established as a companion company to J.W. Foster and Sons, founded in 1895 in
				Bolton,
				Lancashire, England.[9] From 1958 until 1986, Reebok clothing featured the Union Flag to signify the
				company's
				British origins.[10]
				<br>
				<br>
				The company's global headquarters are located in Boston, Massachusetts,[11] U.S., with regional offices
				in
				Amsterdam, Montreal, Hong Kong, and Mexico City.
				<br>
				<br>
				In November 2016, Reebok announced it would be moving its headquarters from the Boston suburb of Canton
				to the
				innovation and design building in the seaport district of South Boston. The reasons for the move,
				according to
				the company, were to be located in an urban environment that is more desirable to millennial workers and
				to
				“clarify the roles” of United States offices.[12] The move was completed in fall of 2018.[13]

			<h3>History</h3>
			<hr>
			<h2>Early history</h2>
			<p>
				In 1895, Joseph William Foster at the age of 14 started work in his bedroom above his father's sweatshop
				in
				Bolton, England, and designed some of the earliest spiked running shoes.[14] After his ideas progressed,
				he
				founded his business 'J.W. Foster' in 1900, later he joined with his sons and changed the company name
				to J.W.
				Foster and Sons.[15][16] Foster opened a small factory called Olympic Works, and gradually became famous
				among
				athletes for his "running pumps".[14] For pioneering the use of spikes, the company's revolutionary
				running
				pumps appear in the book, Golden Kicks: The Shoes that changed Sport.[17] The company began distributing
				shoes
				across the Union Jack flag which were worn by British athletes.[17] They were made famous by 100m
				Olympic
				champion Harold Abrahams (who would be immortalised in the Oscar winning film Chariots of Fire) in the
				1924
				Summer Olympics held in Paris.[17][18]
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1958, in Bolton, two of the founder's grandsons, Joe and Jeff Foster, formed a companion company
				"Reebok,"
				having found the name in a South African dictionary won in a running race by Joe Foster as a boy.[15]
				The name
				is Afrikaans for the grey rhebok, a type of African antelope.[17][19]
			</p>
			<h3>U.S. market</h3>
			<p>
				In 1979, at the Chicago International Sneaker Trade show an American businessman, Paul Fireman, took
				notice of
				Reebok. Fireman was working for team sports and negotiated a deal to license and distribute the Reebok
				brand in
				the United States. The division was called <b>Reebok USA Ltd</b>.[20] Later that year, Fireman
				introduced three
				new
				shoes to the market at $60. By 1981, Reebok reached more than $1.5 million in sales.[9]
			</p>
			<h2>1980s–1990s</h2>
			<p>
				In 1982, Reebok debuted the Reebok Freestyle aerobics shoe, the first athletic shoe designed for
				women.[9][21]
				The following year, Reebok's sales were $13 million.[22]
			</p>
			<p>
				The company began expanding from tennis and aerobics shoes to running and basketball throughout the mid
				to late
				1980s, the largest segments of the athletic footwear industry at the time.[23] Fireman bought the
				English-based
				parent company in 1984. In addition to its IPO, the brand will conquer[promotion?] tennis with the
				Newport
				Classic, popularized by Boris Becker and John Mc Enroe, and the Revenge Plus, better known today under
				its name
				Reebok Club C.
			</p>
			<p>
				Officially an American company in 1985, Reebok had its initial public offering on the New York Stock
				Exchange
				under the ticker symbol RBK.[18][23]
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1986, Reebok switched its logo from the Union Jack flag it had since its founding, to the Vector logo
				- an
				abstract Union Jack streak across a race track - which mirrored the design of the side flashes of its
				shoes[24][25] The switch signaled the transition of the company into a performance brand as it began
				licensing
				deals with professional athletes in the NBA and NFL.[26]
			</p>
			<p>
				During the 1980s, Reebok began introducing sports clothing and accessories (alongside entering the
				college/pro
				sports arena), along with a new line of children's athletic shoes (called 'Weeboks').[27] By mid-decade,
				Reebok's sales were about $1 billion.[6] One of the company's most iconic technologies,[28] the Reebok
				Pump,
				debuted in 1989[29][30] with more than 100 professional athletes wearing the footwear by 1992, including
				Shaquille O'Neal.[9][31]
			</p>
			<p>
				Reebok worked with fitness professional Gin Miller in the late 1980s to develop Step Reebok, based on
				Miller's
				wooden prototype step and her ideas for step aerobics. The Step was evaluated in physiology trials
				undertaken by
				Drs. Lorna and Peter Francis at San Diego State University. In August 1989 the Step was ready, made in
				molded
				plastic by Sports Step of Atlanta with Reebok's name on it,[32] and by March 1990, the step aerobics
				classes
				were attracting media attention.[33] Miller promoted Step Reebok in person, touring the U.S. and
				demonstrating
				it at exercise studios. Step aerobics became widely popular, helping the company sell many thousands of
				adjustable-height step devices, and millions of high-top shoes with ankle support.[19] Step aerobics
				peaked in
				1995 with 11.4 million people exercising in that style.[34]
			</p>
			<p>
				Reebok named Carl Yankowski president and chief executive officer of the brand in 1998, replacing former
				president Robert Meers.[35][36] Yankowski stepped down one year later to accept an executive position at
				another
				company. Reebok chairman and CEO Paul Fireman took over as president for the first time in 12 years.[36]
