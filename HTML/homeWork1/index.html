<h1>Arnold Schwarzenegger</h1>

<p>
    Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born in Thal on July 30, 1947, the second son of Aurelia (née Jadrny) and Gustav
    Schwarzenegger. His mother was of Czech descent, while his paternal great-grandfather, Wenzel Mach, was also
    Czech and came from the village of Chocov near Mladá Vožice. Wenzel had a child out of wedlock with Kunigunde
    Schwarzenegger, and the child (Schwarzenegger's paternal grandfather) was originally named Carl Mach but later
    adopted his mother's surname Schwarzenegger.
