<p>
    The flag of Ukraine is a banner of two equally sized horizontal bands of blue and yellow (Constitution of Ukraine,
    Article 20). The top represents sky and the yellow represents wheat. The combination of blue and yellow as a symbol
    of Ukrainian lands comes from the flag of the Kingdom of Galiciaâ€“Volhynia used in the 12th century. As a national
    flag, the blue and yellow bicolour has been officially used since the 1848 Spring of Nations, when it was hoisted
    over the Lviv Rathaus. It was officially adopted as a state flag for the first time in 1918 by the short-lived West
    Ukrainian People's Republic and subsequently used by the Ukrainian People's Republic. When Ukraine was part of the
    Soviet Union, the flag was outlawed and, before 1949, there was no official state flag until adoption of the
    red-azure flag of the Ukrainian SSR. The blue and yellow flag was provisionally adopted for official ceremonies in
    September 1991 following Ukrainian independence, before finally officially being restored on 28 January 1992 by the
    parliament of Ukraine.

    23 August is celebrated as the Day of the National Flag in Ukraine; beginning with 2004. 24 July was previously
    marked as National Flag Day in Kyiv. The first ceremonial raising of the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag in modern
    times took place on July 24, 1990 at the flagstaff of the Kyiv City Council, two years before the flag was
    officially adopted as the National flag. Since 1992 Independence Day of Ukraine is celebrated on 24 August.
    Following government decree, the flag must be flown from public buildings on this dates and some other holidays. Not
    all of these days are public holidays. Flags also must be flown on election days for the Verkhovna Rada in addition
    to other regional-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the
    president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags would be at half-mast), can be declared at the
    discretion of the Cabinet of Ministers. When flags are required to be flown at half-mast, vertical flags are not
    lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the mast (if hung from a pole) or to each end of
    the flag's supporting cross-beams (if flown like a banner).
